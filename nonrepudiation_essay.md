✪ What is nonrepudiation in the context of digital systems?

-Nonrepudiation in the context of digital systems refers to the assurance that a transaction or communication cannot be denied by any of the parties involved.
It ensures that once an action or decision is made, the person or entity responsible cannot later claim they didn’t take part in the event.    

✪ Why is it important for applications like online bookstores?

In the context of online bookstores nonrepudiation plays a crucial role in securing transactions.
Because it prevents customers or merchants from later denying their actions, such as making a purchase or processing a payment.
This helps avoid disputes related to financial transactions, product delivery, or refunds.
Without nonrepudiation, trust in the system would be undermined, potentially leading to fraud or misuse.

✪ What other tools/technologies besides logging can help achieve nonrepudiation?
Other tools and technologies that support nonrepudiation include digital signatures and encryption.
Digital signatures use cryptographic techniques to verify the identity of the sender and the integrity of the message.
Encryption ensures that data is protected from tampering during transmission.
Additionally, secure audit trails, time-stamping, and multi-factor authentication can further reinforce nonrepudiation by making it harder for unauthorized parties to alter or deny actions.
